On Ubuntu, using Docker through the command-line interface (CLI) is generally the preferred and more straightforward approach. Unlike Windows and Mac, Ubuntu does not require Docker Desktop to run Docker effectively. The CLI on Ubuntu offers robust functionality and is well-integrated with the Linux environment.

Here are a few reasons why using the CLI on Ubuntu might be easier and more efficient:

1. **Native Support**: Docker runs natively on Linux, and Ubuntu is one of the most popular distributions for Docker deployments. This means you can work directly with Docker without the need for additional layers or virtualization tools.

2. **Performance**: Running Docker directly on your Linux system can offer better performance compared to using Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac, as there's no need for a virtual machine or hypervisor layer.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Docker on Ubuntu uses system resources more efficiently, as it doesn't require the overhead of Docker Desktop.

4. **Full Control and Flexibility**: The CLI gives you full control over Docker, allowing you to use all Docker commands and features. It's also easier to automate tasks using scripts.

5. **Learning and Community Support**: The Docker CLI is widely used by the Docker community, so most online resources, tutorials, and community support forums focus on the CLI. Learning to use Docker through the CLI can deepen your understanding of Docker's workings.

To install Docker on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update your package index**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. **Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. **Set up the stable repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. **Update the apt package index again**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

6. **Install the latest version of Docker CE (Community Edition)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce
   ```

7. **Verify that Docker is installed correctly** by running the hello-world image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

Remember, you'll need to use `sudo` to run Docker commands unless you add your user to the `docker` group, which you can do with `sudo usermod -aG docker your-username`. After adding your user to the `docker` group, you need to log out and back in for the changes to take effect.
